### Experience

**Internship at Intelligent Information Systems Research Group EKU**
> It was an eight week internship that I done in the summer of 2020. I have a chance to get more experience in JavaScript. Itroduced to new JS based frameworks such as React and NodeJS. I had a really good mentor. He taught me how to design and create a React front end application, how to create faker service in NodeJS so I can develop a front end without a back end. It was very usefull.

### Education

#### EszterhÃ¡zy KÃ¡roly University
> At the classes we learned the fundamentals of programming, algorithms, design patters, networks, artificial intelligence, some mobile app development(android), web development with php and how to create a Rest API with java and spring.
> 
> At the university we have an oportunity to be a part of a research group. I took the oportunity and joined. I'm learned a lot about dockerizing, microservices and the full stack development introduced as well. Trough four semesteron every friday from 8am to 4pm we are at the university and learning new technologies.
>
> In final thesis, I have to refactor an exicting project and created an enviroment which is based on a Micro Service architecture where each current subsystem will be a service. For this I designed the environment, dockerized the subsystems, created the environment with nginx and tested it.
