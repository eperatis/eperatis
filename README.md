### Experience

**Angular developer at Shiwaforce.com**
> As an Angular developer at Shiwaforce, I underwent 3 months of training in JavaScript, TypeScript and Angular before securing an onsite position with a partner company (OTP Bank). My responsibilities included creating new app pages, implementing functions, connecting to backend APIs, refactoring modules, writing unit tests, integrating Google Analytics, working with cookies, and keeping up-to-date with the latest Angular version.

**Internship at Intelligent Information Systems Research Group EKU**
> It was an eight week internship that I done in the summer of 2020. I have a chance to get more experience in JavaScript. Itroduced to new JS based frameworks such as React and NodeJS. I had a really good mentor. He taught me how to design and create a React front end application, how to create faker service in NodeJS so I can develop a front end without a back end. It was very usefull.

### Education

#### EszterhÃ¡zy KÃ¡roly University
> At the classes we learned the fundamentals of programming, algorithms, design patters, networks, artificial intelligence, some mobile app development(android), web development with php and how to create a Rest API with java and spring.
> 
> At the university we have an oportunity to be a part of a research group. I took the oportunity and joined. I'm learned a lot about dockerizing, microservices and the full stack development introduced as well. Trough four semester on every friday from 8am to 4pm, we are at the university and learning new technologies.
>
> In final thesis, I had to desing and create the front end for an existing application and I had to refactor an exicting project. Unfortunately, the back end wasn't ready to develop the front end, so I can olny just designed the structure. And created an environment, which is based on a Micro Service architecture, where each current subsystem will be a service. For this I designed the environment, becouse the back end it wasn't ready, I only had a chance to test it on a smaller project. 
>> For the environment design I used:
